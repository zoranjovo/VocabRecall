## How to run

1. Navigate into the `vocabrecall-nextjs` directory.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npx prisma db push`.
4. Edit the `.env` if you want to alter default settings.
5. Run `npm run build`.
6. To start the program, run `next start`. This will start it on port 3000. If you want a different port you can run `next start -p 8080`.

You may need to run `npm install next -g` to be able to run `next start`. If you are fine with port 3000 then you can just run `npm run start`.
